## Objective
"To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools,
methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules
covered during training."

This was the objective I have to complete and to break it down it means I have to create an application
which can Create, Read, Update and, Delete records from a database

## ERD
![ERD](https://github.com/ryanpurchase288/week-6-project/blob/main/images/Project_ERD.png?raw=true)

This is my Entity Relationship Diagram. I decided not to include the description of the Game from the Game table just for display reasons on the flask page as it was not a neccessary data to have in the table.


## Software Development



## Testing
This is the test coverage I have achieved on my project:
![Test Coverage](https://github.com/ryanpurchase288/week-6-project/blob/main/images/coverage.PNG)

I have conducted both unit testing and intergration testing. With unit testing I conducted tests which ensures all the pages/views can be accessed by the user. I also tests the functions for adding a game and a session to make sure the tables are related and working together. I also tested the update function to ensure that it is able to read and update the data.  I have planned to also do the delete test to ensure that the full CRUD application is working.
